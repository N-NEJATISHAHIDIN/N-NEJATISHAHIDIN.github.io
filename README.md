# About
My name is Negar. I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at George Mason University. My research expertise lies in the areas of Computer Vision, 3D Scene Understanding, and Deep Learning. I am focusing on object pose estimation, 3D reconstruction, and 3D modeling for robots. My research centers on developing more generalized approaches to create representations that enable robots to better understand the 3D world. These methods can be applied to unseen real-world environments and can benefit multiple tasks simultaneously. Currently, I am working as a graduate research assistant at [Dr. Kosecka's Lab](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=sQ6l4sMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

### Structured Spatial Reasoning with Open Vocabulary Object Detectors
[Publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07394)
[Publication](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=f8ApFaFW3x)

Spatial reasoning is crucial for robotic tasks like fetch-and-delivery, object rearrangement, and search. Detecting and localizing objects accurately is key to success. Recent work leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to improve this capability. We propose a structured probabilistic approach that combines rich 3D geometric features with open-vocabulary object detectors to enhance spatial reasoning. We evaluate our method against zero-shot VLM performance on spatial reasoning tasks using annotated clauses from the RGB-D Active Vision Dataset and the synthetic Semantic Abstraction dataset. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art open-source VLMs by over 20% in grounding spatial relations.


### Graph-CoVis
[Publication](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023W/OmniCV/papers/Nejatishahidin_Graph-CoVis_GNN-Based_Multi-View_Panorama_Global_Pose_Estimation_CVPRW_2023_paper.pdf)

In this paper, we address the problem of wide-baseline camera pose estimation from a group of 360deg panoramas under upright-camera assumption. To exploit the benefits of multi-view logic in a learning-based framework, we introduce Graph-CoVis, which nontrivially extends CoVisPose from relative two-view to global multi-view spherical camera pose estimation. Graph-CoVis is a novel Graph Neural Network based architecture that jointly learns the co-visible structure and global motion in an end-to-end and fully-supervised approach.

### Object Pose Estimation
[Publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9981452)

This work proposes a novel pose estimation model for object categories that can be effectively transferred to previously unseen environments. In this work, we propose a model for pose estimation that can be trained with small amount of data and is built on the top of generic mid-level represen-tations (e.g. surface normal estimation and re-shading). In addition, we introduce a new pose estimation benchmark for commonly encountered furniture categories on challenging Active Vision Dataset.

### Fingerspelling PoseNet
[Publication](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2024W/WVLL/papers/Fayyazsanavi_Fingerspelling_PoseNet_Enhancing_Fingerspelling_Translation_With_Pose-Based_Transformer_Models_WACVW_2024_paper.pdf)

We address the task of American Sign Language fingerspelling translation using videos in the wild. We exploit advances in more accurate hand pose estimation and propose a novel architecture that leverages the transformer based encoder-decoder model enabling seamless contextual word translation. The translation model is augmented by a novel loss term that accurately predicts the length of the finger-spelled word, benefiting both training and inference. We also propose a novel two-stage inference approach that re-ranks the hypotheses using the language model capabilities of the decoder.

### Review on 6D Object Pose Estimation
[Publication](https://www.oajaiml.com/uploads/archivepdf/24821141.pdf)

In this study, we will explore the available methods based on input modality, problem
formulation, and whether it is a category-level or instance-level approach. As a part of our
discussion, we will focus on how 6D object pose estimation can be used for understanding
3D scenes.
