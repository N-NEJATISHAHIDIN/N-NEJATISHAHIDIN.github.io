# About
My Name is Negar. I am Computer Science PH.D student at George Mason University. My reaserch experties are in the area of Computer Vision, 3D scene Underestanding, and Deep Learning. I am focusing on object pose estimation, 3D reconstruction, and 3D modeling for robots. My research centers on making more generalized approaches to develop representations that allow robots to better understand the 3D world. Methods that can be applied to unseen real-world environments and can benefit multiple tasks at once. I am currently working as a graduate research assistant at Dr. Kosecka's Lab.

## Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
